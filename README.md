# Flick Articles

These are the codes for the website [Flick Articles](https://www.flickarticles.com/). Project is made with React (Nextjs) in the frontend and Nodejs (Express) and Mongodb (Mongoose) in the backend.

## Running development servers

If you want to run this app on your machine, do the following steps

- In your development terminal run:

```bash
cd ./backend
npm run docker
```

Then your backend should be live at localhost:5000 (docker needs to be installed on your system for this to work)

- In a seperate terminal, from root directory run:

```bash
cd ./frontend
npm install
npm run start
```

Your frontend should be live at port written at the terminal.
