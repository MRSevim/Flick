        </p>
        <h2>5. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>
          All content on the Website, including graphics, logos, software, and
          content supplied by {envVariables.websiteName} or its content
          suppliers, is the property of {envVariables.websiteName} and protected
          by copyright laws. User-generated content, such as articles, remains
          the property of the respective users. However, by submitting content
          to the Website, users grant {envVariables.websiteName} a
          non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide license to use, distribute,
          display, and create derivative works from their content.
        </p>
        <h2>6. Dispute Resolution</h2>
        <p>
          Any disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Website
          shall be resolved through binding arbitration, except for any disputes
          arising from the rights and obligations regarding intellectual
          property, which may be brought before the appropriate court of
          jurisdiction.
        </p>
        <p>
          For disputes not related to intellectual property, the arbitration
          shall be conducted under the rules of an internationally recognized
          arbitration body, such as the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC)
          or the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law
          (UNCITRAL). The place of arbitration shall be neutral and agreed upon
          by both parties.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the event of any disputes arising from intellectual property
          rights, the parties agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of
          the international courts, such as the International Court of Justice
          (ICJ) or another appropriate international arbitration tribunal.
        </p>
        <p>
          This clause shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with
          the principles of international law, rather than the laws of any
          specific country.
        </p>

        <p>
          We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. Your continued
